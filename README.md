1.	Installation of Icarus

Icarus.apk may be downloaded from the following link: https://github.com/qiikaii/ICT2202-Icarus/blob/main/app/release/Icarus.apk

Thereafter, user should install Icarus as seen in Figure 1.1

Figure 1.1 Installation of Icarus


Upon launching Icarus, users must provide Icarus with permission to access the file manager.
If not, the application will not be able to provide its service.

If permission has been granted, a success message will popup.

2.	Icarus Feature: Analysis

Users may select “SELECT FILE TO ANALYSE” to begin the analysis of the file system information. However, before that begins, user has to ensure that their phone must have access to the image file in the internal storage or in the external storage.

Upon execution, users will be brought to the file manager to select the image that they want to analyse. From there, users should navigate to the storage that holds the image file and select it.

Thereafter Icarus will start to process and retrieve the relevant file system information. The users can scroll down to see the information about the file system.

3.	Icarus Feature: Carving

Figure 3.1 Home Page of Icarus


Users may select “SELECT FILE TO CARVE” to begin the analysis of the file system information. However, before that begins, user has to ensure that their phone must have access to the image file in the internal storage or in the external storage.

Upon execution, users will be brought to the file manager to select the image that they want to analyse. From there, users should navigate to the storage that holds the image file and select it.

Thereafter Icarus will start to process and carve out the files in the image. The users can scroll down to see the information about the file and directories that are carved out.

Figure 3.4 Information on the files and directories that are carved by Icarus


The users can go to the internal storage to find the folder “Icarus” to see the files stored in the image. They are stored according to how many partitions there are.

The users can freely explore the content as if they are accessing the image directly.
